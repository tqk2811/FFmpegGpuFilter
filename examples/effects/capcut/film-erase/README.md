# Film Erase

Flickering film-burn light leaks (orange, red and blue washes, a scratched streak and dust specks) are added over the picture frame by frame, while a slanted edge sweeps down from the top and wipes the second clip in. Drive `progress` from 0 to 1.

Recreated from the CapCut transition of the same name; CapCut's default length for it is about 0.8 s, so drive `progress` over roughly that long.

Timing: the burn runs through 44 film frames over the transition; the wipe edge travels from 32 % to 68 % of it. No textures are used: the burn footage is replaced by procedural two-tone leaks with noise, grain, an edge streak and dust, added (clipped) onto the picture. As in CapCut, the leak is already on screen at the very first and last moments of the transition. The 720 x 720 scene covers frames of other shapes.

## Inputs

- `first`: Outgoing clip
- `second`: Incoming clip (must have the same size as the first input)

## Output

Same size as the first input (`first`). Pixel format: the input's, when the effect may output it (the manifest has no `output` rule).

## Options

Written inline after the package name: `film-erase.zip=name=value`. Several options are separated by `&` in an FFmpeg `effect='...'` string (`:` also works but must be written `\:` there) or by `:` in `gpufx run`. A value is a literal or an FFmpeg expression in `t`, `n`, `w`, `h`, `a`, `sar`, `dar`; commas inside an FFmpeg command line are escaped as `\,`. See the repo [README](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/README.md) and [EFFECT_FORMAT](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/docs/EFFECT_FORMAT.md).

| Name | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `progress` | float | `0.5` | 0 to 1 | 0 = first clip, 1 = second clip |

## Example

```sh
ffmpeg -init_hw_device vulkan=vk:0,disable_multiplane=1 -filter_hw_device vk -i a.mp4 -i b.mp4 -filter_complex \
  "[0][1]gpufx=effect='film-erase.zip=progress=clip((t-1)/0.8\,0\,1)',hwdownload,format=yuv420p" out.mp4
```

Direct3D 12 (Windows):

```sh
ffmpeg -init_hw_device d3d12va=dx -filter_hw_device dx -i a.mp4 -i b.mp4 -filter_complex \
  "[0][1]gpufx=effect='film-erase.zip=progress=clip((t-1)/0.8\,0\,1)',hwdownload,format=nv12" out.mp4
```

The effect runs on every backend the filter supports (Vulkan, D3D12/D3D11, Metal on macOS); see the [README](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/README.md).

With the `gpufx` CLI on two PNGs:

```sh
gpufx run 'film-erase.zip=progress=0.5' -i a.png -i b.png -o out.png
```
