# PAL Bars

PAL 75% or 100% color bars (generator).

## Inputs

- `src`

Any size; any pixel format that gpufx converts on the GPU. It only sets the size (see Notes).

## Output

Same size as the first input (`src`). Pixel format: the input's, when the effect may output it (the manifest has no `output` rule).

## Options

Written inline after the package name: `palbars.zip=name=value`. Several options are separated by `&` in an FFmpeg `graph='...'` string (`:` also works but must be written `\:` there) or by `:` in `gpufx run`. A value is a literal or an FFmpeg expression in `t`, `n`, `w`, `h`, `a`, `sar`, `dar`; commas inside an FFmpeg command line are escaped as `\,`. See the repo [README](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/README.md) and [EFFECT_FORMAT](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/docs/EFFECT_FORMAT.md).

| Name | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `full` | bool | `false` |  | false: 75% bars (pal75bars), true: 100% bars (pal100bars) |
| `opacity` | float | `1` | 0 to 1 | Blend over the input picture: 1 = only the generated picture, 0 = the input unchanged |

A `color` is `#rrggbb`.

## Example

```sh
ffmpeg -init_hw_device vulkan=vk:0,disable_multiplane=1 -filter_hw_device vk -f lavfi -i color=black:s=1280x720:r=25 \
  -vf "format=nv12,gpufx=graph='palbars.zip=full=1',hwdownload,format=nv12" -t 10 out.mp4
```

The effect runs on every backend the filter supports (Vulkan, D3D12/D3D11, Metal on macOS); see the [README](https://github.com/tqk2811/FFmpegGpuFilter/blob/master/README.md).

With the `gpufx` CLI on a PNG:

```sh
gpufx run 'palbars.zip=full=1' -i in.png -o out.png
```

## Notes

Port of FFmpeg's `pal75bars` and `pal100bars` sources (vsrc_testsrc.c) in one package. Differences: one package with a `full` switch instead of two filters; the Y'CbCr values (BT.601, limited range) are decoded to RGB.

The effect has no source of its own: gpufx effects always have an input, so the input `src` only sets the size (and is blended in by `opacity`). Use any video of the wanted size, for example `-f lavfi -i color=black:s=1280x720:r=25`.
